## Live Lecture on Youtube 11.Oct.2023 7:30 pm Berlin Germany

### queues

 - [ ] FiFo (first in, first, out)
   - [ ] enqueue
   - [ ] dequeue

```C
 const int CAPACITY = 50 

 typedef struct
 {
    person people[CAPACITY];
    int size
 }
queue;
```

---

### Stacks

 - [ ] LIFO (Last in, First Out)
   - [ ] Push
   - [ ] Pop


```C
 const int CAPACITY = 50 

 typedef struct
 {
    person people[CAPACITY];
    int size
 } 
stack;
```

---

### arrays

> ðŸ’¡ stores data contiguously , back to back to back

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int *list = malloc(3 * size0f(int));
    if (list == NULL)
    {
        return 1
        };

list[0] = 1:
list[1] = 2;
list[2] = 3;


int *tmp = malloc(4 * sizeof(int));
if (temp == NULL)
{
    free(list);
    return 1;
}


for( int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    temp[i] = list[i]:
}
tmp[3] = 4;

free(list)
list = tmp;


for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    printf("%i\n", list[i])
}
}
```

### struct 

 `.`  go into
 `*` point at  
 `->` go into ...

---

## linked lists

- [ ] located somewhere in memory but linked by pointers. we can locate at random location as long as we link the chucks with pointers.

- [ ] trade off is gonna be space, or time. twice as much space (one for data + address to the next location)


Node1 = 1 0x123, + (location for the next item) 0x456
Node 2 =2 0x456,  + (location for the next item) 0x789
Node 3 =3 0x789,  + (location for the next item) NULL

`Meta-data` is the extra Pointer, value + meta- data 


``` C
typedef struct
{
    string name;
    string number;
} person;

typedef struct
{
    char* name;
    char *number;
} person;

typedef struct node
{
    int number;
    node *next
} node

// note top to bottom read `node` has to be mentioned before it returns and is usable
```

```C
node *list = NULL;
// set it NULL!!!

node *n = malloc(sizeof(node));


(*n).number = 1; // star `n` pointer, `.dot` go in, `=` assign 1
n -> number = 1 // does the same just nicer syntax

list = n ;

node *n = malloc(sizeof(2))

n -> number = 2
n -> next = list
list = n;

//oder of oporations matter to not loose data
```


 ```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef struct node
{
    int number;
    struct node *next;

}node

int main ( int argc , char* argv[])
{
    node *list =Null;

     (for i = 1; i< argc; i++>)
    {
        int number = atoi(argv[i];
        
        node *n = malloc *sizeof(node));
        if (n== NULL)
{
    // free memory thus fR
   return 1;
}        
     {
        printf("%i\n",argv[i])
     }   
    }


n -> number= number;
n -> next = list;
list =n  -->


// print whole list 
node *ptr = lsit;
while (ptr !=NULL){
}

}
// run time how much does it cost to insert into a linked list (prepend, prepend) O(1)/ constant time! `O of 1`, searching run time: O(n) / as many items as in the list, each hast to be checked.
// Binary search does not work on Linked list?
